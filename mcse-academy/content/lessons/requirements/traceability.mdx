<Callout type="info" title="Concept">
Traceability stops requirements from drifting. Every goal maps to constraints, to tests, to telemetry fields, and to owners. When one changes, you know what to update.

### Failure mode focus
- Orphan tests or telemetry. Fix with matrices and CI checks.
- No owner. Fix with RACI column.
