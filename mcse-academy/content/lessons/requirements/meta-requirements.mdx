<Callout type="info" title="Concept">
Meta-cognitive requirements define how the system notices, critiques, and adapts its own thinking. They are measurable and testable like functional requirements.

- Calibration targets (ECE <= threshold)
- Escalation and abstain policies
- Safety and compliance constraints

### Failure mode focus
- Vague requirements -> untestable. Fix with metrics + thresholds.
- Requirements not tied to telemetry. Fix with schema references.
