## Concept explanation
The stack organizes cognition and meta-cognition: perception normalizes inputs, representation holds state + uncertainty, reasoning plans, action executes, and the meta-layer monitors, critiques, calibrates, and governs adaptation. Memory spans working, episodic, semantic, procedural, and external tools.

### Failure mode focus
- Missing meta-layer hooks -> no ability to critique actions.
- Memory writes without provenance -> drift and corruption.
