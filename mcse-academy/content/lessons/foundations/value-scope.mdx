## Concept explanation
MCSE success is explicit: what to optimize, what to avoid, and how to measure. Boundaries stop scope creep and make governance testable.

### Failure mode focus
- Implicit goals cause reward hacking; fix with signed constraints and tests.
- Scope creep hides risk; fix with boundary doc + ADR.
