<Callout type="info" title="Concept">
MCSE inherits from multiple fields but adds *meta-cognitive* obligations: explicit self-monitoring, policy-as-code, and governance loops that regulate how cognition runs and adapts.
</Callout>

## Comparison table (plain text)
- **CSE**: optimizes human performance in complex systems. MCSE: adds self-observation and safety gates for AI+human cognition.
- **HFE**: UX and ergonomics. MCSE: telemetry + governance for cognition, not just usability.
- **Control theory**: stability. MCSE: applies control to *thinking loops* plus semantics, values, and ethics.
- **LLMOps**: deploy LLMs. MCSE: wraps LLMs with calibration, memory policies, safety policies, and incident learning.

  prompt="What artifact is uniquely emphasized by MCSE?"
  options=["UI mockups", "Incident-free uptime", "Policy-as-code + meta-cog telemetry", "GPU scheduling"]
  answer={2}
  explanation="MCSE requires policy-as-code, telemetry, and governance for cognition; uptime or UI alone are insufficient."

  starter={`# ADR: Adopt MCSE over LLMOps\n## Context\n- System: \n- Risks: hallucination, miscalibration, tool overreach\n## Decision\n- Add meta-monitor + meta-critic + calibration + safety policy engine\n## Consequences\n- More upfront design, clearer governance, safer rollout\n## Signals\n- ECE <0.05, self-detect rate >70%, jail-break rate <1%\n`}
/>

### Failure mode focus
- **Metric soup**: tracking accuracy only. Fix with meta-metrics (ECE, self-detect rate, recovery time).
- **Blind autonomy**: no escalation path. Fix with abstain + human-in-loop.
