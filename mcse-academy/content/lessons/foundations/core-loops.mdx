## Concept explanation
Monitoring captures signals, critique checks against policies, calibration scores confidence, adaptation updates policies/tools. Loops must be explicit with thresholds and fallbacks.

### Failure mode focus
- Silent monitors (no thresholds). Mitigate with alerts + actions.
- Critic without teeth. Mitigate with block/abstain actions.
