<Callout type="info" title="Concept">
Meta-Cognitive Systems Engineering makes the *monitoring, critique, calibration, and governance* of cognition first-class requirements. You are engineering systems that know how they think, measure how well that thinking works, and change safely when reality shifts.
</Callout>

## Why MCSE exists

- Cognition alone is fragile under shift and adversaries; meta-cognition adds self-observation and safe adaptation.
- It forces explicit goals, constraints, telemetry, and postmortems into the architecture—not bolted on later.

## Boundaries
- MCSE is *not* just analytics. It defines control points that can stop, adapt, or escalate decisions.
- MCSE is *not* generic systems thinking. It is architecture + metrics + governance targeted at cognition and meta-cognition.

### Failure mode focus
- Miscalibration: overconfident plans with low evidence.
- Missing governance: no escalation path -> silent failure.
- Mitigate with abstain thresholds, dual safety (rules + model), and postmortems.
