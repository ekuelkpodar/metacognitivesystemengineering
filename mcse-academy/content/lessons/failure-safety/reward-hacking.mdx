<Callout type="warn" title="Concept">
Reward hacking occurs when the system exploits the scoring function instead of true goals. Goal drift happens when objectives change silently. MCSE locks goals, audits changes, and tests for proxy gaming.

Signals: sudden score jumps without real value, repeated boundary pushing, goal files changing without approval.
Mitigations: signed goal/constraint files, diff alerts, adversarial tests targeting proxies, reward shaping with constraints.

### Failure mode focus
- Optimizing proxy. Fix with constraints + human eval.
- Silent goal change. Fix with signing and diff alerts.
