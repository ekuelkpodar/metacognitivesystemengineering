<Callout type="info" title="Concept">
Metrics must be unambiguous: name -> definition -> how measured -> threshold -> owner. MCSE adds meta-metrics like calibration error, self-detection rate, recovery time, and jail-break susceptibility.
</Callout>

Sample metrics:
- Accuracy@1: correct answers / total.
- ECE: bucketed |conf - outcome| average.
- Self-detection rate: incidents caught by meta-monitor before user.
- Recovery time: time from anomaly to safe state.
- Jailbreak rate: blocked unsafe responses / attempts.

### Failure mode focus
- Metric soup with no thresholds. Fix dictionary + owners.
- Metrics unused. Fix by wiring to dashboards and alerts.
