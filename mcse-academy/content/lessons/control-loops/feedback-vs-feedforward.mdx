<Callout type="info" title="Concept">
Feedback loops compare expected vs observed outcomes; feedforward anticipates disturbances. In MCSE, feedback loops wrap cognition (plan -> act -> observe) while feedforward uses environment signals (volatility, risk) to pre-adjust policies.

- Feedback catches deviations; slower but stabilizing.
- Feedforward speeds response to known shifts (e.g., spike in adversarial prompts).
- Combine both for robustness: pre-adjust risk budgets then confirm via telemetry.

  explanation="Feedforward is helpful when you can sense disturbances early (e.g., volatility flags)."

### Failure mode focus
- Over-feedback -> oscillation. Mitigate with damping, hysteresis.
- Missing feedforward -> slow to known shocks. Add volatility sensors.
