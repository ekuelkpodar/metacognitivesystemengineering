Safety + governance:
- PHI scrubber + allowlisted outputs
- Safety engine with clinical rule base
- Meta-monitor on uncertainty; escalate to clinician when confidence<0.7 or risk>0.3
- Immutable audit logs for compliance

### Failure mode focus
- PHI leak. Mitigate with scrubbers + allowlist.
- Wrong advice. Mitigate with calibration + mandatory clinician approval.

### References
- HIPAA-style checklists
